Acceptance of the Terms of Service</h4><p>Welcome to Aderbal! (a.k.a. &quot;we&quot; or &quot;us&quot; or the &quot;Company&quot;). We are excited to have you as user and member of the community. The following terms and conditions (collectively, these &quot;Terms of Service&quot;) apply to your use of www.aderbal.com, including any content, functionality and services offered on or via Aderbal.com (the &quot;Website&quot;). The Terms of Service also include our Privacy Policy, that you can review here: http://www.aderbal.com/privacy</p><p>We want to keep our relationship with you as lean and informal as possible, but please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start using Aderbal, because by using the Website you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service.</p><p>Should you disagree with some of the provisions herein, you can either leave the Website (although we&#x27;ll be sad to see you go!), or contact us at support@aderbal.com. Aderbal is all about collaborating for improving legal documents, and we&#x27;ll be happy to hear your comments and suggestions.</p><h4>2. Changes to the Terms of Service and the Website</h4><p>Aderbal is a work in progress, meaning that a lot will change in the near future. We reserve the right to update the Website and these Terms of Service from time to time, at our discretion. We will make sure to announce any major change in a prominent way, but since &quot;major&quot; is a very subjective concept, you can always monitor and subscribe to changes via our TOS Tracker (yes, we track our own Terms!). Of course, this document is public on Aderbal, and you will be able to see the changes for any new version (just click on the &quot;See all versions&quot; button on the right). Your continued use of the Website following the publishing of updated Terms of Service means that you accept and agree to the changes.</p><h4>3. Accessing the Website,Security and Privacy</h4><p>We are working hard on improving Aderbal, but we can&#x27;t guarantee that the Website will be up and running 24/7. We also reserve the right to suspend or restrict access to some features to users. In any case, we will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Website is unavailable at any time or for any period, nor for any data loss (see also section 7 below).</p><p>To access certain features of the Website you have to register by entering your email and choosing a password as part of our security procedures. You must treat such information as confidential, not disclosing it to any third party and only using Aderbal in person. There is a password reset procedure in case you forget your password, but please notify us of any breach of security. We highly recommend to choose a strong password (e.g. &quot;correcthorsebatterystaple&quot;) and that you log out from your account at the end of every session.</p><p>It is a condition of your use of the Website that all the information you provide on the Website is correct, current and complete. In the future, you may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. As custom for internet websites, we reserve the right to disable any user account, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including, if in our opinion you have failed to comply with any provision of these Terms of Service.</p><p>We use SSL encrypted browsing for all logged-in users, but we cannot guarantee that all use will be secure.
